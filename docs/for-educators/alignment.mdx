  <h1>Alignment with District Goals</h1>
  <p>How AutoNateAI Supports Your Strategic Priorities</p>
</div>

School districts don't need another program that exists in isolation. You need solutions that **amplify and accelerate** the work you're already doing.

AutoNateAI's Critical Thinking + AI Workshop directly supports the strategic priorities that matter most to districts nationwide.

## AI Literacy & Digital Citizenship

As AI becomes ubiquitous, districts need to prepare students to use it responsibly and effectively.

<div className="callout callout-warning">
  <strong>⚠️ What Most AI Literacy Programs Miss:</strong> They focus on how AI works, AI ethics, and AI dangers—but they don't teach students how to actually USE AI as a thinking tool.
</div>

### What AutoNateAI Teaches

<div className="feature-cards">
  <div className="feature-card">
    <h3>✅ AI as a Thought Partner</h3>
    <p>Use AI to challenge assumptions, explore alternatives, and strengthen reasoning</p>
  </div>
  <div className="feature-card">
    <h3>✅ Effective Prompting</h3>
    <p>Ask questions that generate insight, not just answers</p>
  </div>
  <div className="feature-card">
    <h3>✅ Critical Evaluation</h3>
    <p>Assess AI outputs for accuracy, bias, and relevance</p>
  </div>
  <div className="feature-card">
    <h3>✅ Ethical Use</h3>

  </div>
  <div className="feature-card">
    <h3>✅ Limitations Awareness</h3>
    <p>What AI can and can't do, when to rely on human judgment</p>
  </div>
</div>

<div className="callout callout-success">
  <strong>✓ This is the AI literacy that will matter for the next 50 years.</strong>
</div>

## Equity & Access

### Closing Opportunity Gaps

<div className="callout callout-warning">
  <strong>⚠️ Critical thinking is often treated as a "gifted" skill—something only advanced students need. This is wrong and harmful.</strong>
  
  <strong>All students</strong>—regardless of background, prior achievement, or zip code—deserve to learn how to think.
</div>

### How AutoNateAI Promotes Equity

<div className="feature-cards">
  <div className="feature-card">
    <h3>✅ Universal Design</h3>
    <p>Frameworks accessible to all learners, not just high achievers</p>
  </div>
  <div className="feature-card">
    <h3>✅ Scaffolded Support</h3>
    <p>AI provides personalized guidance at each student's level</p>
  </div>
  <div className="feature-card">
    <h3>✅ Multiple Entry Points</h3>
    <p>Challenges can be approached in many ways</p>
  </div>
  <div className="feature-card">
    <h3>✅ Asset-Based</h3>
    <p>Build on students' existing knowledge and experiences</p>
  </div>
  <div className="feature-card">
    <h3>✅ Culturally Responsive</h3>
    <p>Scenarios reflect diverse contexts and perspectives</p>
  </div>
  <div className="feature-card">
    <h3>✅ Technology Access</h3>
    <p>We work with schools to ensure no student is excluded</p>
  </div>
</div>

<div className="callout callout-info">
  <strong>📚 The Research:</strong> Studies show that explicit instruction in thinking skills disproportionately benefits students from under-resourced communities, who are less likely to develop these skills through informal learning at home.
  
  <strong>Teaching critical thinking is an equity imperative.</strong>
</div>
