## Educational Guardrails

### Teaching Ethical AI Use

We don't just tell students "don't do this"—we teach them **why** and **how** to use AI responsibly.

      <li>AI doesn't "understand"—it pattern-matches</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Key lesson:</strong> <em>"AI is a tool, not a truth machine."</em></p>
  </div>
