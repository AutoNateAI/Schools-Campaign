# Moderation and Safety

## How We Keep Students Safe While Using AI

**AI is powerful—and with power comes responsibility.**

We've built comprehensive safety protocols to ensure students use AI ethically, safely, and responsibly.

---

## Our Safety Philosophy

### Three Pillars of Safe AI Use

🛡️ **Technical safeguards**: Filters, monitoring, and age-appropriate content  
🛡️ **Educational guardrails**: Teaching ethical use, not just preventing misuse  
🛡️ **Human oversight**: Trained facilitators monitor all interactions

**Safety isn't just about blocking—it's about teaching judgment.**

## Technical Safeguards

### What's Built Into the Platform

✅ **Content filtering**:
- Profanity blockers
- Inappropriate topic detection
- Age-appropriate language models

✅ **Prompt monitoring**:
- All AI interactions are logged
- Flagged content triggers alerts
- Facilitators review suspicious activity

✅ **Rate limiting**:
- Students can't spam the system
- Prevents misuse and gaming

✅ **No external access**:
- Students can't share prompts outside the platform
- All interactions stay within our secure environment

**Technology creates the safety net—but education builds the parachute.**

## Educational Guardrails

### Teaching Ethical AI Use

We don't just tell students "don't do this"—we teach them **why** and **how** to use AI responsibly.

#### Module 1: Understanding AI Limitations

Students learn:
- AI can hallucinate (make up information)
- AI reflects biases in training data
- AI doesn't "understand"—it pattern-matches

**Key lesson**: *"AI is a tool, not a truth machine."*

#### Module 2: Ethical Prompting

Students learn:
- When AI enhances thinking vs. replaces it
- How to cite AI assistance appropriately
- The difference between collaboration and cheating

**Key lesson**: *"Use AI to think better, not to avoid thinking."*

#### Module 3: Recognizing Manipulation

Students learn:
- How AI can be used to persuade or deceive
- How to spot AI-generated misinformation
- How to verify AI outputs

**Key lesson**: *"Question everything—even the AI."*

## Human Oversight

### Trained Facilitators Monitor Everything

👁️ **Real-time monitoring**:
- Facilitators see all Discord channels
- AI interactions are logged and reviewable
- Flags trigger immediate review

👁️ **Intervention protocols**:
- Inappropriate use results in private conversation
- Repeated violations result in parent notification
- Serious violations result in removal from program

👁️ **Support, not punishment**:
- First response is educational, not punitive
- Students learn from mistakes in a safe environment
- Goal is growth, not compliance

**We're not policing—we're coaching.**

🔒 **What we DON'T collect**:
- Social Security numbers
- Home addresses
- Personal contact information
- Sensitive demographic data

🔒 **How we protect data**:
- Encrypted storage (AES-256)

## Discord-Specific Safety

### How We Keep Discord Safe

🛡️ **Private servers**: Only enrolled students have access  
🛡️ **No DMs**: Students can't message each other privately  
🛡️ **Moderated channels**: All discussions are public and monitored  
🛡️ **Profanity filters**: Automated content moderation  
🛡️ **Age verification**: Students must verify enrollment  
🛡️ **Parent access**: Parents can view (but not post in) channels

**Discord becomes a classroom—not a social network.**

---

## AI Prompt Safety

### What Students Can and Can't Do

✅ **Allowed**:
- Ask AI to challenge their assumptions
- Use AI to explore alternative perspectives
- Request AI to explain complex concepts
- Generate practice scenarios

❌ **Not allowed**:
- Ask AI to complete assignments for them
- Generate content to submit as their own work
- Use AI to bypass thinking
- Share AI outputs without attribution

**We teach the line—and why it matters.**

---

## Incident Response

### What Happens If Something Goes Wrong

**Step 1: Immediate intervention**
- Facilitator addresses issue in real-time
- Student is reminded of guidelines
- Conversation is documented

**Step 2: Educational conversation**
- Facilitator discusses why the behavior was problematic
- Student reflects on better choices
- Plan for future behavior is created

**Step 3: Parent notification** (if needed)
- Parents are informed of serious violations
- Collaborative plan is developed
- Student continues with support

**Step 4: Removal** (rare)
- Only for repeated serious violations
- Full refund provided to sponsor
- Student can reapply after 6 months

**Our goal is always education first.**

> — Parent, pilot program

> *"The facilitators were amazing. When my son made a mistake, they turned it into a teaching moment instead of a punishment."*  
> — Parent, Michigan

> *"I appreciated being able to view the Discord channels. I could see exactly what my child was learning."*

## The Bottom Line

**Safety isn't about control—it's about trust.**

We trust students to learn. We trust educators to guide. We trust parents to support.

And we build systems that make that trust possible.
