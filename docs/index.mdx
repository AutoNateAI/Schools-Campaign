  <h1>Welcome to Critical Thinking with AI</h1>
  <p>Preparing Students for an AI-Powered Future</p>
</div>

In a world where artificial intelligence is reshaping every industry, **the ability to think critically is no longer optional—it's essential**. AutoNateAI's Critical Thinking with AI Workshop equips your students with the cognitive tools they need to thrive in the 21st century.

## What AutoNateAI Is

AutoNateAI is an educational technology company focused on one mission: **teaching students how to think, not just what to think**. We combine cutting-edge AI tools with proven cognitive science to help students develop metacognitive skills—the ability to understand and direct their own thinking.

<div className="callout callout-info">
  <strong>💡 Beyond the Workshop:</strong> Unlike traditional workshops that end when the session does, we provide <strong>year-long support</strong> through our AI Prompts & Reflection Portal.
</div>

## Why Critical Thinking with AI Matters

Your students are growing up in a fundamentally different world than previous generations:

- **Information overload**: Students have access to more information than ever, but struggle to evaluate, synthesize, and apply it
- **AI everywhere**: ChatGPT, Claude, and other AI tools are already in students' hands—they need to learn how to use them as thinking partners, not crutches
- **Future workforce demands**: Employers consistently rank critical thinking, problem-solving, and adaptability as the most valuable skills
- **College readiness gap**: Many students arrive at college unprepared for independent thinking and self-directed learning

<div className="callout callout-success">
  <strong>✓ The solution isn't more content—it's better thinking.</strong>

### Hosted on Discord

We use Discord as our learning management system because:

- **Real-time engagement** — Live discussions, instant feedback, and collaborative learning
- **Safe and moderated** — Private channels with educator oversight
- **Data-rich** — Every interaction produces insights you can review

    <h3>We Teach the Operating System</h3>
