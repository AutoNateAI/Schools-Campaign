# Welcome to AutoNateAI Schools

## Preparing Students for an AI-Powered Future

In a world where artificial intelligence is reshaping every industry, **the ability to think critically is no longer optional—it's essential**. AutoNateAI's Critical Thinking + AI Workshop equips your students with the cognitive tools they need to thrive in the 21st century.

### What AutoNateAI Is

AutoNateAI is an educational technology company focused on one mission: **teaching students how to think, not just what to think**. We combine cutting-edge AI tools with proven cognitive science to help students develop metacognitive skills—the ability to understand and direct their own thinking.

Our flagship 2-hour workshop transforms how students approach learning, problem-solving, and decision-making. But unlike traditional workshops that end when the session does, **we provide year-long support** through our AI Prompts & Reflection Portal.

### Why Critical Thinking + AI Matters

Your students are growing up in a fundamentally different world than previous generations:

- **Information overload**: Students have access to more information than ever, but struggle to evaluate, synthesize, and apply it
- **AI everywhere**: ChatGPT, Claude, and other AI tools are already in students' hands—they need to learn how to use them as thinking partners, not crutches
- **Future workforce demands**: Employers consistently rank critical thinking, problem-solving, and adaptability as the most valuable skills
- **College readiness gap**: Many students arrive at college unprepared for independent thinking and self-directed learning

**The solution isn't more content—it's better thinking.**

### Overview of the Workshop Experience

Our 2-hour workshop is structured around the **Learn → Apply → Reflect → Discuss** cycle:

#### Three 35-Minute Learning Modules

Each module follows the same powerful pattern:

1. **10 minutes: Concept Introduction** — Students learn a specific thinking framework (like causal reasoning, perspective-taking, or insight mapping)
2. **10 minutes: AI-Guided Challenge** — Students apply the framework through an interactive digital activity
3. **7.5 minutes: Small Group Breakout** — Groups of 5 students discuss their approaches and insights
4. **7.5 minutes: Personal Reflection** — Students journal about what they learned and how they'll apply it

#### Hosted on Discord

We use Discord as our learning management system because:

- **Students already know it** — No learning curve for the platform
- **Real-time engagement** — Live discussions, instant feedback, and collaborative learning
- **Safe and moderated** — Private channels with educator oversight
- **Data-rich** — Every interaction produces insights you can review

### What Makes This Program Different

#### 1. **We Teach the Operating System, Not the Apps**

Most programs teach students *how to use* specific tools. We teach students *how to think*—a skill that transfers to every subject, every challenge, and every stage of life.

#### 2. **AI as a Thinking Partner**

We don't ban AI or treat it as cheating. We teach students how to use AI to **enhance their thinking**, not replace it. This is the literacy skill of the 21st century.

#### 3. **Year-Long Value**

When you sponsor a student, they don't just get a 2-hour workshop. They get **12 months of access** to our AI Prompts & Reflection Portal—hundreds of guided conversations designed to help them navigate school, relationships, goals, and personal growth.

#### 4. **Measurable Impact**

Every reflection, every discussion, and every AI interaction produces data. You'll see:

- How students' reasoning evolves over time
- Which thinking frameworks they use most
- Where they struggle and where they excel
- Longitudinal growth in metacognitive awareness

#### 5. **Aligned with Your Goals**

This program directly supports:

- **Portrait of a Graduate** competencies
- **21st Century Learning Standards**
- **College and Career Readiness** frameworks
- **Social-Emotional Learning (SEL)** objectives
- **AI Literacy and Digital Citizenship** initiatives
