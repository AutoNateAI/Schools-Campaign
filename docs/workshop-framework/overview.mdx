## Module Breakdown

### Module 1: Causal Reasoning & Systems Thinking

**Learning Objective**: Students learn to identify cause-and-effect relationships and understand how systems interact.

**Framework Taught**:
- First-order vs. second-order effects
- Feedback loops and unintended consequences
- Root cause analysis

<div className="callout callout-info">
  <strong>🎯 AI-Guided Challenge: "The Decision Architect"</strong><br/>
  Students are presented with a real-world scenario (e.g., "Your school wants to ban phones during lunch"). They use AI to explore: What are the immediate effects? What are the long-term effects? Who benefits? Who is harmed? AI prompts them to think deeper: "What assumptions are you making?" "What evidence would change your mind?"
</div>

**Small Group Discussion**:
- Groups of 5 share their causal maps
- Compare different perspectives
- Identify blind spots in each other's reasoning

**Personal Reflection**:
- Students journal: "What surprised me about this exercise?"
- "How could I use this framework in my own life?"
- "What's one decision I'm facing where this applies?"

---

### Module 2: Perspective-Taking & Empathetic Reasoning

**Learning Objective**: Students develop the ability to understand and reason from multiple viewpoints.

**Framework Taught**:
- Steelmanning (arguing the strongest version of an opposing view)
- Cognitive empathy vs. emotional empathy
- Identifying hidden assumptions and values

<div className="callout callout-info">
  <strong>🎯 AI-Guided Challenge: "The Perspective Simulator"</strong><br/>
  Students are given a controversial topic relevant to their lives. They must argue FOR and AGAINST the position. AI helps them strengthen both arguments. Students identify which perspective they find most compelling and why.
</div>

**Small Group Discussion**:
- Share the strongest argument for the "other side"
- Discuss: "What did I learn by trying to understand a different view?"
- Explore: "How does this change how I approach disagreements?"

**Personal Reflection**:
- "When have I dismissed someone's perspective without understanding it?"
- "How can I use this skill in my relationships?"

---

### Module 3: Insight Mapping & Knowledge Connection

**Learning Objective**: Students learn to connect ideas across subjects and contexts.

**Framework Taught**:
- Analogical reasoning
- Pattern recognition across domains
- Building mental models

<div className="callout callout-info">
  <strong>🎯 AI-Guided Challenge: "The Insight Connector"</strong><br/>
  Students pick a concept they're learning in school (e.g., photosynthesis, supply and demand, narrative structure). AI helps them find connections to 3 other domains (sports, relationships, technology, etc.). Students create an "insight map" showing how the same pattern appears everywhere.
</div>

**Small Group Discussion**:
- Share insight maps
- Challenge each other: "Does this connection really hold?"
- Build on each other's ideas

**Personal Reflection**:
- "What's the most surprising connection I found?"
- "How does seeing patterns across subjects change how I learn?"
- "What's one insight I want to remember?"

## Why This Structure Works

<div className="feature-cards">
  <div className="feature-card">
    <span className="feature-card-icon">🎯</span>
    <h3>Active Learning</h3>
    <p>Students retain <strong>90%</strong> of what they practice and apply immediately, compared to just <strong>5%</strong> from lectures</p>
  </div>
  <div className="feature-card">
    <span className="feature-card-icon">🧠</span>
    <h3>Metacognition Built In</h3>
    <p>Reflection phases force students to think about their thinking—transforming a one-time lesson into a lifelong skill</p>
  </div>
  <div className="feature-card">
    <span className="feature-card-icon">🤖</span>
    <h3>AI as Thought Partner</h3>
    <p>Students use AI to challenge assumptions, explore perspectives, and strengthen reasoning—not just get answers</p>
  </div>
  <div className="feature-card">
    <span className="feature-card-icon">👥</span>
    <h3>Small Groups Build Confidence</h3>
    <p>Groups of 5 create psychological safety while providing diverse perspectives</p>
  </div>
</div>

## What Students Walk Away With

<div className="callout callout-success">
By the end of the 2-hour workshop, students will:

- ✅ Understand how to break down complex problems into cause-and-effect relationships
- ✅ Know how to argue multiple sides of an issue with intellectual honesty
- ✅ Be able to find patterns and connections across different subjects
- ✅ Have practiced using AI as a thinking tool, not a shortcut
- ✅ Have reflected on their own thinking process and identified areas for growth
- ✅ Feel confident that they can apply these frameworks to any challenge
</div>
