  <h1>Discord as a Learning Management System</h1>
  <p>Why We Use Discord (And Why It Works Better Than Traditional LMS)</p>
</div>

Most schools use clunky, outdated learning management systems that students tolerate but don't love. **We use Discord—and students actually engage.**

## The Problem with Traditional LMS Platforms

<div className="feature-cards">
  <div className="feature-card">

  <div className="feature-card">
    <span className="feature-card-icon">🚫</span>
    <h3>Zero Social Connection</h3>

  </div>
  <div className="feature-card">
    <span className="feature-card-icon">⏸️</span>
    <h3>No Real-Time Collaboration</h3>

  </div>
</div>

<div className="callout callout-warning">
  <strong>⚠️ The Result:</strong> Students log in, complete tasks, log out. No community, no engagement, no excitement.

## How We Use Discord in the Workshop

### 1. Private, Moderated Channels

Each workshop cohort gets:

<div className="feature-cards">
  <div className="feature-card">
    <span className="feature-card-icon">📢</span>
    <h3>#announcements</h3>
    <p>Workshop schedule and updates</p>
  </div>
  <div className="feature-card">
    <span className="feature-card-icon">💬</span>
    <h3>#general-chat</h3>
    <p>Casual discussion and questions</p>
  </div>
  <div className="feature-card">
    <span className="feature-card-icon">🧠</span>
    <h3>#module-discussions</h3>
    <p>Dedicated channels for each thinking framework</p>
  </div>
  <div className="feature-card">
    <span className="feature-card-icon">✍️</span>
    <h3>#reflections</h3>
    <p>Private space for journaling and metacognition</p>
  </div>
  <div className="feature-card">
    <span className="feature-card-icon">📚</span>
    <h3>#resources</h3>
    <p>Links, videos, and supplemental materials</p>
  </div>
</div>

<div className="callout callout-info">
  <strong>🛡️ Safety First:</strong> All channels are monitored by facilitators and protected by safety protocols.
</div>

### 2. Real-Time Collaboration

During the workshop:

- **Voice channels** for small group discussions
- **Screen sharing** for collaborative problem-solving
- **Polls and reactions** for instant feedback
- **Breakout threads** for focused debates

**Students engage in ways that feel natural—not forced.**

### 3. Year-Long Community Access

After the workshop, students keep access to:

- **Monthly challenge prompts** delivered via Discord bot
- **Peer discussions** with other workshop alumni
- **Office hours** with facilitators (optional)
- **Resource library** that grows over time

<div className="callout callout-success">
  <strong>✓ Discord becomes a thinking community, not just a course platform.</strong>
