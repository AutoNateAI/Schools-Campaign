## Module Breakdown

### Module 1: Causal Reasoning & Systems Thinking

**Learning Objective**: Students learn to identify cause-and-effect relationships and understand how systems interact.

**Framework Taught**:
- First-order vs. second-order effects
- Feedback loops and unintended consequences
- Root cause analysis

**AI-Guided Challenge**: "The Decision Architect"
- Students are presented with a real-world scenario (e.g., "Your school wants to ban phones during lunch")
- They use AI to explore: What are the immediate effects? What are the long-term effects? Who benefits? Who is harmed?
- AI prompts them to think deeper: "What assumptions are you making?" "What evidence would change your mind?"

**Small Group Discussion**:
- Groups of 5 share their causal maps
- Compare different perspectives
- Identify blind spots in each other's reasoning

**Personal Reflection**:
- Students journal: "What surprised me about this exercise?"
- "How could I use this framework in my own life?"
- "What's one decision I'm facing where this applies?"

---

### Module 2: Perspective-Taking & Empathetic Reasoning

**Learning Objective**: Students develop the ability to understand and reason from multiple viewpoints.

**Framework Taught**:
- Steelmanning (arguing the strongest version of an opposing view)
- Cognitive empathy vs. emotional empathy
- Identifying hidden assumptions and values

**AI-Guided Challenge**: "The Perspective Simulator"
- Students are given a controversial topic relevant to their lives
- They must argue FOR and AGAINST the position
- AI helps them strengthen both arguments
- Students identify which perspective they find most compelling and why

**Small Group Discussion**:
- Share the strongest argument for the "other side"
- Discuss: "What did I learn by trying to understand a different view?"
- Explore: "How does this change how I approach disagreements?"

**Personal Reflection**:
- "When have I dismissed someone's perspective without understanding it?"
- "How can I use this skill in my relationships?"

---

### Module 3: Insight Mapping & Knowledge Connection

**Learning Objective**: Students learn to connect ideas across subjects and contexts.

**Framework Taught**:
- Analogical reasoning
- Pattern recognition across domains
- Building mental models

**AI-Guided Challenge**: "The Insight Connector"
- Students pick a concept they're learning in school (e.g., photosynthesis, supply and demand, narrative structure)
- AI helps them find connections to 3 other domains (sports, relationships, technology, etc.)
- Students create an "insight map" showing how the same pattern appears everywhere

**Small Group Discussion**:
- Share insight maps
- Challenge each other: "Does this connection really hold?"
- Build on each other's ideas

**Personal Reflection**:
- "What's the most surprising connection I found?"
- "How does seeing patterns across subjects change how I learn?"
- "What's one insight I want to remember?"

## Why This Structure Works

### 1. **Active Learning, Not Passive Listening**

Research shows that students retain:
- **5%** of what they hear in a lecture
- **50%** of what they discuss in a group
- **75%** of what they practice doing
- **90%** of what they teach others or apply immediately

Our workshop maximizes retention by cycling through all these modes.

### 2. **Metacognition is Built In**

The reflection phases force students to think about their thinking—the core of metacognition. This is what transforms a one-time lesson into a lifelong skill.

### 3. **AI as a Thought Partner**

Students don't just use AI to get answers. They use it to:
- Challenge their assumptions
- Explore alternative perspectives
- Strengthen their reasoning
- Identify gaps in their logic

This is the AI literacy skill that will matter for the next 50 years.

### 4. **Small Groups Build Confidence**

Many students are afraid to speak up in large groups. Groups of 5 create psychological safety while still providing diverse perspectives.

### 5. **Immediate Applicability**

Every framework is taught through real-world scenarios students care about. They leave the workshop thinking: "I can use this today."

## What Students Walk Away With

By the end of the 2-hour workshop, students will:

✅ Understand how to break down complex problems into cause-and-effect relationships  
✅ Know how to argue multiple sides of an issue with intellectual honesty  
✅ Be able to find patterns and connections across different subjects  
✅ Have practiced using AI as a thinking tool, not a shortcut  
✅ Have reflected on their own thinking process and identified areas for growth  
✅ Feel confident that they can apply these frameworks to any challenge
