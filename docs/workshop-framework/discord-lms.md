# Discord as a Learning Management System

## Why We Use Discord (And Why It Works Better Than Traditional LMS)

Most schools use clunky, outdated learning management systems that students tolerate but don't love. **We use Discord—and students actually engage.**

### The Problem with Traditional LMS Platforms

❌ **Boring interfaces** that feel like homework  
❌ **Complicated navigation** that confuses students  
❌ **Zero social connection** between learners  
❌ **No real-time collaboration** or discussion  
❌ **Students log in, complete tasks, log out** (no community)

### Why Discord Changes Everything

✅ **Students already use it** for gaming and communities  
✅ **Real-time chat and voice channels** for instant collaboration  
✅ **Threaded discussions** keep conversations organized  
✅ **Bots and integrations** make learning interactive  
✅ **Mobile-friendly** so students can engage anywhere  
✅ **Community-driven** so students learn from each other

**Discord turns learning into a social experience—not a solitary task.**

## How We Use Discord in the Workshop

### 1. Private, Moderated Channels

Each workshop cohort gets:
- **#announcements**: Workshop schedule and updates
- **#general-chat**: Casual discussion and questions
- **#module-discussions**: Dedicated channels for each thinking framework
- **#reflections**: Private space for journaling and metacognition
- **#resources**: Links, videos, and supplemental materials

**All channels are monitored by facilitators and protected by safety protocols.**

### 2. Real-Time Collaboration

During the workshop:
- **Voice channels** for small group discussions
- **Screen sharing** for collaborative problem-solving
- **Polls and reactions** for instant feedback
- **Breakout threads** for focused debates

**Students engage in ways that feel natural—not forced.**

### 3. Year-Long Community Access

After the workshop, students keep access to:
- **Monthly challenge prompts** delivered via Discord bot
- **Peer discussions** with other workshop alumni
- **Office hours** with facilitators (optional)
- **Resource library** that grows over time

**Discord becomes a thinking community, not just a course platform.**

## Safety & Moderation

### We Take Safety Seriously

🛡️ **Private servers**: Only enrolled students have access  
🛡️ **Age-appropriate content**: All discussions are moderated  
🛡️ **No DMs between students**: Channels are public and monitored  
🛡️ **Profanity filters**: Automated moderation tools  
🛡️ **Adult supervision**: Facilitators monitor all activity  
🛡️ **FERPA & COPPA compliant**: Student data is protected

**Parents and educators can request access to view (but not participate in) discussions.**

## What Educators Are Saying

> *"I was skeptical about Discord at first, but seeing how engaged my students were changed my mind. They were actually excited to log in and discuss ideas."*  
> — Middle school teacher, pilot program

> *"Discord removed the barrier between 'school learning' and 'real life.' Students treated it like a community, not an assignment."*  
> — High school principal, Michigan

## The Bottom Line

**Discord isn't just a tool—it's a community.**

Students don't just complete tasks—they engage, collaborate, and think together.

And that's where real learning happens.
